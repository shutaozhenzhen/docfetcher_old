<h1 id="title">Known
bugs and limitations</h1>
<h2>General<br></h2><ul>


<li>If you've encountered a bug not listed here, chances
are&nbsp;it will
disappear after upgrading to a <a href="http://java.com">Java
Runtime</a> as new as or newer as
version 1.6.0, which is the version DocFetcher has been developed on.
To determine what version of the Java Runtime
you're running on, open a command prompt and type in "java -version"
(without the parentheses).</li>
<li>If you use virtual desktops, switching between them may
cause DocFetcher to hide in the System Tray.</li></ul><h2>On Windows</h2><ul><li>DocFetcher may crash after removing two or more indexes at
once or after shutting down the program if the "Watch indexed folders"
option was
turned on. It may also crash if that option is turned off via the
Preferences Window. The cause is a bug in one of the libraries used
(JNotify). Currently, there's no other known fix than to disable the
folder watching.</li></ul><h2>On Linux</h2><ul><li>It is&nbsp;recommended to use the official Java
Runtime from Sun instead of the other, partly incomplete
implementations of Java, both for compatibility
and&nbsp;performance
reasons.</li><li>Copying
files from the result panel may not work. Workaround: Open the file's
parent folder (via the context menu of the result panel) and copy the files
from there.</li><li>The
attempt to index folders with symlinks in it can send the program into
an infinite loop if the folder watching is enabled. Again, this is a
bug in JNotify and the only thing you can do about it for now is to
disable the folder watching.</li><li>Moving
files out of watched folders does not cause an index update. You have
to update the affected index manually. Automatic index updates on
deletions do work, however.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Indexing-related<br>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may see a "Not enough memory left in the java virtual machine" error if the file to be indexed is sufficiently big. Read <a href="Indexing_Huge_Documents.html">this</a> for more info.</li><li>All
password protected documents are omitted during the parse process.</li><li>Sometimes a PDF file will be omitted even though you can view its
contents in a normal PDF viewer without having to enter a password. The
likely reason is that this file allows you to view its contents, <span style="font-style: italic;">but</span>
is password protected against copying parts of it and/or modifying its
contents. Now one of the things DocFetcher does with its documents is
to extract text from them. This can be interpreted as some kind of
"copying", which is why you can read the PDF file, but DocFetcher
cannot. Files like that can easily be spotted by the gibberish in their
meta data fields (e.g. in the title field).</li>
<li>Some
parts of OpenDocument and Microsoft Word files are not extracted and
are thus not searchable, such as
text inside formulas and charts.</li>
<li>DocFetcher
can't access CHM files that are being viewed by the default Windows CHM
viewer (this has not been tested for other CHM viewers). Therefore you
should close all CHM files you want to index.</li>
<li>Some files will
not be indexed at all even if they appear to be completely valid
documents. This is the case with some PowerPoint and PDF files, which
appear to contain text, but actually consist of (scanned) images only.
To find out what is really extracted from a particular document, you
can use the built-in "Parser Testbox" by pressing F11.</li>
<li>A word that spans two or more lines (i.e. is
divided by line breaks) is not searchable.</li>
</ul>
