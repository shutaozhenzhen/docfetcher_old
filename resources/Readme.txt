DocFetcher @VERSION@ - General description
=============================================
DocFetcher is an Open Source desktop search application: It allows you to quickly access documents on your computer by typing keywords. - You can think of it as Google for your local document repository.


System requirements
=============================================
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.6.0 or higher, is required. To find out what JRE version you have, open a command prompt and type in "java -version".
You can download Java for Windows from here: http://java.com. If you're on Linux, have a look at the official software repository of your distro.

Platform-specific requirements:
  * The Windows version runs on Windows XP and Vista. Windows 98 is not supported. Other Windows operating systems may also work, but have not been tested and are not officially supported.
  * The Linux version only runs on GTK-based distros. This includes GNOME- and Xfce-based distros such as Ubuntu / Xubuntu and excludes all Qt/KDE-based distros. To find out what desktop environment your distro is built on, have a look at this list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions#Technical
  * The portable version runs on all operating systems supported by either the Windows version or the Linux version.


How to start DocFetcher
=============================================
  * Windows: Doubleclick on DocFetcher.exe (recommended) or DocFetcher.bat
  * Linux: Doubleclick on DocFetcher.sh. If you're using the portable version, you'll have to set the executable flag first: Open a terminal, navigate to the DocFetcher folder using the "cd" command, then enter "chmod +x DocFetcher.sh".
