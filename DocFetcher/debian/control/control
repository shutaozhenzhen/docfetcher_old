Description: Find documents that contain specific keywords
 DocFetcher is a desktop search application: It allows you to perform fast searches for all documents in a given set of folders that contain certain keywords. - You can think of it as Google for your local document repository.
 .
 The program runs on GTK-based desktop environments (e.g. GNOME). It is recommended to use the Java Runtime Environments from Sun instead of alternative implementations, both for compatibility and performance reasons.
