DocFetcher @VERSION@ Readme
===========================================

DocFetcher is an Open Source desktop search application: It allows you to quickly access documents on your computer by typing keywords. - You can think of it as Google for your local document repository.

System requirements:
  * Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.6.0 or higher. You can download it from here: http://java.com/. To find out what JRE version you have, open a command prompt and type in "java -version".
  * The Windows version runs on Windows 98, XP and Vista. Other Windows operating systems may also work, but have not been tested and are not officially supported.
  * The Linux version only runs on GTK-based distros. This includes GNOME- and Xfce-based distros such as Ubuntu / Xubuntu and excludes all Qt/KDE-based distros.
  * The portable version runs on all operating systems supported by either the Windows version or the Linux version.
  * For Linux users: It is recommended to use the official Java Runtime from Sun instead of the other, partly incomplete implementations of Java, both for compatibility and performance reasons.

How to start DocFetcher:
  * Windows: Doubleclick on DocFetcher.exe (recommended) or DocFetcher.bat
  * Linux: Doubleclick on DocFetcher.sh. You might have to set the executable flag first (open a terminal, cd to the DocFetcher folder, then enter "chmod +x DocFetcher.sh").
