DocFetcher @VERSION@ Readme
===========================================

DocFetcher is an Open Source desktop search application: It allows you to perform fast searches for all documents in a given set of folders that contain certain keywords. - You can think of it as Google for your local document repository.

System requirements:
  * Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.5 or higher. You can download it from here: http://java.com/. To find out what JRE version you have, open a command prompt and type in "java -version".
  * The Windows version of DocFetcher runs on Windows 98, XP and Vista. Other Windows operating systems may also work, but have not been tested and are not officially supported.
  * The Linux version only runs on GTK-based desktops. This includes GNOME-based distros such as Ubuntu and excludes all Qt/KDE-based distros.
  * For Linux users: It is recommended to use the official Java Runtime from Sun instead of the other, partly incomplete implementations of Java, both for compatibility and performance reasons.
