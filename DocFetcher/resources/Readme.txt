DocFetcher @VERSION@ - General description
=============================================
DocFetcher is an Open Source desktop search application: It allows you to quickly access documents on your computer by typing keywords. - You can think of it as Google for your local document repository.


Required: Java Runtime Environment
=============================================
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.6.0 or higher, is required. You can download Java for Windows from here: http://java.com. If you're on Linux, have a look at the official software repository of your distro.
To find out what JRE version you have, open a command prompt and type in "java -version".
For Linux users it is recommended to use the official Java Runtime from Sun instead of the other, partly incomplete implementations of Java, both for compatibility and performance reasons.


Platform-specific notes
=============================================
  * The Windows version runs on Windows 98, XP and Vista. Other Windows operating systems may also work, but have not been tested and are not officially supported.
  * The Linux version only runs on GTK-based distros. This includes GNOME- and Xfce-based distros such as Ubuntu / Xubuntu and excludes all Qt/KDE-based distros.
  * The portable version runs on all operating systems supported by either the Windows version or the Linux version.


How to start DocFetcher
=============================================
  * Windows: Doubleclick on DocFetcher.exe (recommended) or DocFetcher.bat
  * Linux: Doubleclick on DocFetcher.sh. You'll probably have to set the executable flag first: Open a terminal, cd to the DocFetcher folder, then enter "chmod +x DocFetcher.sh". The same applies to the DocFetcher daemon (docfetcher-daemon-linux).
