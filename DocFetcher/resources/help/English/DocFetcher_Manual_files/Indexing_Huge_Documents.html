<h1>Indexing huge documents</h1><p>If the filesize of a document
exceeds a certain value (depends on the filetype, e.g. &gt; 5 MB for
HTML files), DocFetcher won't be able to index it. Instead, you will
see a "Not enough memory" warning, and DocFetcher will skip the file.
Here's what you can do about it:</p><h2>Update the index after restart</h2><p>After
DocFetcher has finished indexing, shut down the program and restart it,
then select "Update" from the context menu of the index&nbsp;the big
file is in. Chances are that immediately after startup there's still
enough memory left to index a file this big.</p><h2>Increase the amount of memory DocFetcher is allowed to use</h2><p>DocFetcher
runs inside a so-called "Java Virtual Machine", which has a limit on
the amount of RAM it's allowed to use - commonly known as the "maximum
heap size". If the document is too big, this limit is reached, and the
indexing fails. You can increase the limit by changing the program
start parameters.&nbsp;The file to be modified depends on the version of DocFetcher you're running:<br></p><ul><li>Windows: DocFetcher.bat - in the program folder to which DocFetcher was
installed (e.g. "c:\program files\docfetcher").</li><li>Linux: DocFetcher.sh - in /usr/share/docfetcher. You will need write permission though.</li><li>Portable: DocFetcher.bat and DocFetcher.sh  - in the directory to which DocFetcher was extracted.</li></ul>All
these files end with a line that starts with&nbsp;"java -cp". Insert
"-Xmx256m"&nbsp;between "java" and "-cp". This will increase the
maximum heap size to 256 MB, which should be sufficient for almost all cases. Now
the last line of the modified file should look like this:<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br></span><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">java -Xmx256m -cp [lots of programmer gibberish here...]</span><br></div><p>Finally, simply save the file and launch DocFetcher with it!<br></p><h2>... or just skip the file</h2>To exclude the file from indexing, you can either move it out of the document repository or <a href="Skip_Files_Regex.html">write a "skip files" expression</a> that matches the&nbsp;file.</div>
