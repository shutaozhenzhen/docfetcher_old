<h1 id="title">Known
bugs and limitations</h1><h2>On Windows</h2><ul><li>DocFetcher may crash after removing two or more indexes at
once or after shutting down the program if the "Watch indexed folders"
option was
turned on. It may also crash if that option is turned off via the
Preferences Window. The cause is a bug in one of the libraries used
(JNotify). Currently, there's no other known fix than to disable the
folder watching.</li></ul><h2>On Linux</h2><ul><li>It is&nbsp;recommended to use the official Java
Runtime from Sun instead of the other, partly incomplete
implementations of Java, both for compatibility
and&nbsp;performance
reasons.</li><li>Copying
files from the result panel may not work. Workaround: Open the file's
parent folder (via the context menu of the result panel) and copy the files
from there.</li><li>The
attempt to index folders with symlinks in it can send the program into
an infinite loop if the folder watching is enabled. Again, this is a
bug in JNotify and the only thing you can do about it for now is to
disable the folder watching.</li><li>Moving
files out of watched folders does not cause an index update. You have
to update the affected index manually. Automatic index updates on
deletions do work, however.</li>
</ul>
<h2>User Interface</h2><ul><li>The highlighting in the preview panel is not fully implemented yet.
Most importantly, if you perform an AND search, such as "dog cat"
(including the quotes), then both "dog" and "cat" will be highlighted
in the preview panel.</li></ul><h2>Indexing-related<br>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>To find out what is actually extracted from a particular document, you
can use the built-in "Parser Testbox" by pressing F11.</li><li>You may see a "Not enough memory left in the java virtual machine" error if the file to be indexed is sufficiently big. Read <a href="Indexing_Huge_Documents.html">this</a> for more info.</li><li>All
password protected documents are omitted during the parse process.</li><li>Sometimes a PDF file will be omitted even though you can view its
contents in a normal PDF viewer without having to enter a password. The
likely reason is that this file allows you to view its contents, <span style="font-style: italic;">but</span>
is password protected against copying parts of it and/or modifying its
contents. Now one of the things DocFetcher does with its documents is
to extract text from them. This can be interpreted as some kind of
"copying", which is why you can read the PDF file, but DocFetcher
cannot. Files like that can easily be spotted by the gibberish in their
meta data fields (e.g. in the title field).</li>
<li>Some
parts of Microsoft Word files are not extracted and
are thus not searchable, such as
text inside formulas and charts.</li>
<li>DocFetcher
can't access CHM files that are being viewed by the default Windows CHM
viewer (this has not been tested for other CHM viewers). Therefore you
should close all CHM files you want to index.</li>
<li>Some files will
not be indexed at all even if they appear to be completely valid
documents. This is the case with some PowerPoint and PDF files, which
appear to contain text, but actually consist of (scanned) images only.
You can use the parser testbox mentioned above to identify these files.</li><li>SVG text extraction does not work if the text is stored as paths (rather than actual text strings).</li>
<li>A word that spans two or more lines (i.e. is
divided by line breaks) is not searchable.</li>
