<h1>Description</h1>
<p>DocFetcher is an Open Source desktop search application: It
allows you to quickly access documents on your computer by
typing&nbsp;keywords. - You can think of it as Google for your
local
document repository.&nbsp;The
application is currently available for Windows and
GTK-based Linux
distributions.</p>
<h1>How It Works</h1>
<ul>
<li>You specify one or more folders to make searchable, e.g.
"C:\MyDocuments".</li>
<li>DocFetcher
extracts the text from all documents in "C:\MyDocuments" that it is
able to read, e.g. HTML, MS Word&nbsp;and PDF, and stores
the result of this processing in "index files".&nbsp;The indexing
process
might take a few minutes (600 documents = about 3 min.).</li>
<li>Now you can type keywords into DocFetcher's search box,
e.g. "fourier analysis",
hit Enter, and DocFetcher will list all documents inside
"C:\MyDocuments" that contain these&nbsp;words - most of the time
in
less than a second.</li>
<li>What if the original document repository is
changed? Then the index files will get out of sync with the repository,
obviously. However: (1) DocFetcher can listen to file system events and
automatically update its index files when it's running. (2) In
constrast to completely (re-)building an index, an index update is
usually a matter of seconds.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1>Supported Document Formats</h1>
<ul>
<li>HTML and plain text (both customizable)</li>
<li>Portable Document Format (pdf)<br>
</li>
<li>Microsoft Office&nbsp;Word (doc), Excel (xls) and
PowerPoint (ppt)</li>
<li>OpenOffice.org Writer, Calc, Draw and Impress</li>
<li>Rich Text Format (rtf)</li>
<li>AbiWord (abw, abw.gz, zabw)</li>
<li>Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (chm)</li>
<li>Microsoft Visio (vsd)</li>
<li>(In the works: MS Office 2007)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Detection of HTML pairs (e.g. "foo.htm" and a folder named
"foo_files")</li>
<li>Various
file operations on the document repository (e.g. creating folders,
inserting new files) can be performed through DocFetcher's interface.</li>
<li>Customizable text and HTML file extensions (e.g. "nfo",
"cpp", "java", "py", "shtml", and so on)</li>
<li>Regular expression based exclusion of files from indexing</li>
<li>Automatic index updates on changes to the indexed documents
(optional).</li>
<li>Preview panel with search-term highlighting and a simple
built-in web browser</li>
<li>Search results can be sorted and filtered by different
criteria (filetype, filesize, path, etc.).</li>
<li>A portable version for both Windows and Linux is available,
which,
amongst other things, is useful in combination with volume encryption (<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Comparison To Other Desktop Search Applications</h1>
Why would you use this program instead of other, more popular and even
apparently more feature-laden desktop search applications such as
Google Desktop Search, Copernic Desktop Search or Beagle? Here's why:
Programs such as these can index a lot more than just documents
(images, videos, e-mails, IM sessions, programs, etc.), and the
author(s) of DocFetcher believe&nbsp;this is mostly a <span style="font-style: italic;">bad</span> thing, for the
following reasons:<br>
<ul>
<li>Why install yet another program to search for images,
music, videos, e-mails, etc., if you can access all of that much more
effectively with your favorite picture browser, media player, e-mail
client, and so on? So, no images, no music, no videos... - what's
left?&nbsp;Documents. And that's what DocFetcher is good for. (By
the
way, <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a>
is recommended for quickly launching start menu programs.)</li>
<li>The real power of Google and other web search engines comes
from
document indexing, because it gives a very good approximation of
the <span style="font-style: italic;">content</span>
of a document. Indexing images or videos however isn't all that useful,
because the real&nbsp;content of an image or a video is not
accessible via text extraction.</li>
<li>Now
that we have web services such as Google Mail that allow you to
maintain
a central e-mail repository which can be&nbsp;accessed from any
computer with
internet connection, what's the point of indexing locally stored
e-mails, other than to make life harder for both developers and users
of desktop search applications? </li>
<li>The bigger the search scope, the more "noise" there will be
on the search result lists. This is why you will find that,
when searching for documents, document-only search
applications such as DocFetcher generally give better
search results than those which also index
non-document files.</li>
<li>Less files to index = faster indexing and decreased CPU
usage. (Don't
you just hate it when there's always some program busily working in the
background?)</li>
</ul>
Other than that, if you don't need eye candy, but want a powerful
Open Source tool that just does what it's supposed to do and nothing
else (e.g. violating your privacy, installing extra stuff you never
wanted), then this program is for you!
